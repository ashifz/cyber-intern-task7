# Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions

## Objective
The goal of this task is to identify and remove potentially malicious or unnecessary browser extensions, thereby improving browser performance and security awareness.

## Steps Performed
1. **Opened Extension Manager:**
   - Accessed Chrome extensions via `chrome://extensions`.

2. **Reviewed Installed Extensions:**
   - Analyzed all installed extensions for suspicious behavior.
   - Checked permissions, developer credibility, user reviews, and functionality.

3. **Identified Suspicious Extensions:**
   | Extension Name        | Reason for Removal                                     |
   |-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
   | PDF Converter Pro     | Excessive permissions, unknown developer               |
   | Weather Tab           | Redirects default search engine, poor user reviews     |
   | Free VPN Proxy        | High access permissions, unnecessary auto-start        |

   4. **Removed Identified Extensions:**
   - Removed all suspicious extensions using Chromeâ€™s "Remove" option.
   - Restarted the browser to apply the changes.

5. **Post-Cleanup Observation:**
   - Browser performance improved.
   - No unexpected pop-ups or redirections observed.

Key Learnings

- Not all browser extensions are safe; some can be used for phishing, data theft, or ad injection.
- Always review extension permissions and install from trusted sources only.
- Unused or unknown extensions should be removed immediately.
- Good extension hygiene improves both browser performance and cybersecurity.
